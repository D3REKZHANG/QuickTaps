# QuickTaps
Tile clicking game with nice sceneries for stress relief and mouse dexterity.
Inspired by www.donttap.com

<h2>Implementation Details</h2>

Written completely in Python using Pygame, a game development module. Code is very short (less than 500 lines), clean and readable. Source code is seperated into three different files for more readability and a more organized design. 

To run the game, simply open/run main.py through Python 2 or 3. Python and Pygame are both required to run the game. 

<h2>Game Details</h2>

The game is very simple. Click 15 black tiles as fast as possible without missing. Clicking elsewhere will end the level and you will have to restart. Pressing any key will pause the game while playing, and simply pressing the keyboard will proceed through the game screens (menu to game, end screen to menu, etc).
